- [feature]: Yaml2env.log_files => Array

- [enhancement]: Make use of 'awesome_print' - with fallback on 'pretty_print' - without breaking Ruby specs; "ordered hash keys" issue causes pain here so disabled it temporarily to get a green build.


== WOULD-BE-NICE

- [review]: Find out best practice for testing Pathname vs. String like this: Pathname.new("/tmp") == "/tmp"

- [spec]: Find out why many specs fail when Yaml2env.env is a ActiveSupport::StringInquirer - works in Rails.
