== WOULD-BE-NICE

- [doc]: Add some usage examples of the new helpers in README.

- [review]: Find out best practice for testing Pathname vs. String like this: Pathname.new("/tmp") == "/tmp"

- [spec]: Find out why many specs fail when Yaml2env.env is a ActiveSupport::StringInquirer - works in Rails.
